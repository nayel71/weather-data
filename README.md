# Analyse Weather Data for Canadian Cities

## Datasets

- `cities.csv`: This has demographic information about Canadian cities and includes the majority of Canada's urban population.  The latitude and longitude values can be used to associate the cities and the weather stations.
- `climate.csv`: This has climate information for a few weeks in early 2020 collected at weather stations around Canada.

## Program

The python program `urban_temp.py` produces weather statistics for urban locations in Canada for any given date(s) based on the datasets.
